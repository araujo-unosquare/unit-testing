FIRST principles

Fast
- Should be fast. Faster tests- faster feedback

Independent
- Tests should be isolated from other tests and external env
    - No shared state

Repeatable
- Same result with same input

Self-validating
- After test is finished, results should be clear

Thorough
- Cover all cases
